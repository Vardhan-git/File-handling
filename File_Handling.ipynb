        "1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " - Interpreted languages: Code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter eg: Python, JavaScript. No separate compilation step; easier for debugging and cross-platform use.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Compiled languages: Code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution eg: C, C++. Generally faster, but less flexible for platform changes\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Exception handling is used to manage errors during program execution without crashing,Uses try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The Code written inside a finally block runs regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is logging in Python?\n",
        " - Process of recording program events, errors or information for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - __del__ method is Called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " - import : imports the entire module where as from import : imports specific objects from the module\n",
        "\n",
        "7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " - Use a tuple after except or multiple except clauses.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " - Ensures resources like files are properly acquired and released Automatically closes the file after usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " - Multithreading: Multiple threads in one process eg: input output bound tasks\n",
        "   multiprocessing: Multiple processes eg: CPU bound tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - logging tracks errors and helps in execution of program  and also useful in monitoring and debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Automatic management of memory allocation and deallocation. Relies on garbage collection and reference counting mechanisms\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - use try block for the codes that may fail, Handle the exceptions using Except\n",
        " , you can also use optional else for the code to run if there are no exceptions, Use finally regardless of the excpetions\n",
        "\n",
        "13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        " - Prevents memory leaks and inefficient resource usage.Ensures program performance and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " - try: Wraps code that might generate exceptions, except: Handles specific exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " - Uses reference counting.An additional garbage collector identifies and frees unused references.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " - Executes if no exception occurred in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " - debug , info , critical , error, warning\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        " - os.fork() creates a child process but it is not available on windows, Multiprocessing is used for highlevel module for parallelism and it is platform independent\n",
        "\n",
        "19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        " - Frees up system resources.Ensures that all data is written and no corruption occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        " - file.read() reads entire file or a specified size.\n",
        " - file.readline() reads a single line from the file\n",
        "\n",
        "21.what is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        " - The logging module in Python is used to record events, errors, warnings, and informational messages that happen during program execution. Logging helps in debugging, monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        " - The os module provides a way to interact with the operating system. In terms of file handling, it lets you perform operations such as:Creating, renaming, and deleting files and directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Challenges that are associated with memory management are:\n",
        "   Memory leaks , circular references , Garbage collection pauses , Lack of manual controls , Difficult to track spikes\n",
        "\n",
        "24.How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        " - You can manually raise exceptions in Python using the raise keyword\n",
        "\n",
        "25.Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        " - It enables better performance for applications that perform many I/O-bound operations, letting other threads run while one waits for a response.\n",
